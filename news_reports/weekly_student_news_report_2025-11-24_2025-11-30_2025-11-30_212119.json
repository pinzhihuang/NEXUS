    "english_summary": "Federal immigration enforcement operations are set to escalate in New York City, according to a recent announcement from White House immigration advisor Tom Homan. In a Tuesday interview, Homan stated that the increased enforcement presence is a direct response to the city’s long-standing sanctuary policies, which limit local cooperation with federal immigration agencies. This announcement follows a recent incident where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared on Canal Street during the arrest of an undocumented vendor. While President Trump said he would not deploy the National Guard for this purpose, the stated increase in ICE operations remains a key development. Separately, MTA officials reported that a thief stealing copper wires caused over 700 subway delays last month. These disruptions primarily affected evening rush hour service on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines.",

In response to student questions about securing jobs and internships, Chikvaidze acknowledged that the UN lacks a clear \"docking point\" for young people to get involved. He advised students interested in international affairs to first identify their desired position, focus on their personal strengths, and learn how to emphasize what makes them a strong candidate. Chikvaidze also stressed the importance of celebrating small victories while pursuing long-term goals. The talk was part of the International Human Rights Activism and Education class, led by Professor Heddy Lahmann, which is exploring migration as its annual theme this year.",

    "english_summary": "A study by NYU Langone Health researchers has found that a reduced sense of smell can persist for years after a COVID-19 infection, often without the person realizing it. The research, led by Grossman professor Leora Horwitz, involved over 3,500 participants who were monitored for nearly four years and assessed using a 40-scent scratch-and-sniff test. A key finding was that among post-COVID participants who believed their sense of smell was normal, 66% actually had a measurable deficiency, known as hyposmia. Professor Horwitz warned that this impairment has serious daily life consequences, such as an inability to detect gas leaks, smoke, or spoiled food, and can also lead to malnourishment from a loss of interest in eating. While no definitive treatments exist, researchers noted smell training offers some benefits and recommended screening for long-term COVID-19 patients, as the condition is difficult to self-detect.",

    "english_summary": "A pilot initiative at New York University’s Silver School of Social Work is using virtual simulations to train students, aiming to address a citywide shortage of mental health professionals. A study on the program, which began in 2023, found it helps students build practical clinical skills in response to a 15.6% vacancy rate for mental health provider roles in New York City. In the training, students practiced real-life interactions, such as suicide risk assessments, with virtual and actor-based models in a low-stakes environment. While beneficial, some students found the automated feedback intimidating, and instructors noted the technology is still in its early stages. According to researcher Anne Dempsey, these simulations mitigate challenges in student internships where patient confidentiality can limit live feedback. Silver is now collaborating with the Tandon and Steinhardt schools to develop a fully AI-powered virtual reality simulation, set to launch this spring.",

The research revealed that while New York City offers access to 74 of 75 tracked specialties, it has only 4.7 specialists per 1,000 residents. This shortage results in significant challenges for residents, including longer wait times for appointments, bounced referrals, and an overreliance on primary care doctors. According to lead author Tian Gan, a Tandon Ph.D. candidate, specialties related to geriatric care, like urology, are particularly lagging. The study also identified addiction and preventive medicine as among the most underrepresented fields in metropolitan areas.
