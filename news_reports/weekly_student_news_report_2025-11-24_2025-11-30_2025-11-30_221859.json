    "english_summary": "Federal immigration enforcement operations will escalate in New York City, according to an announcement by White House immigration advisor Tom Homan. He stated the increase in enforcement is a direct response to the city's long-standing sanctuary policies, which limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents. This development follows recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity on Canal Street, including the earlier detention of nine people. While President Trump stated he would not deploy the National Guard to the city, Homan confirmed \"we will increase the enforcement presence.\"\n\nSeparately, students and residents should be aware of significant subway disruptions. MTA officials reported that a \"serial copper thief\" was responsible for over 700 subway delays last month. The thefts, occurring near the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station in the Bronx, caused major track circuit failures during evening rush hours, impacting service on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines.",

He advised students to first understand the specific position they want, then focus on emphasizing their unique strengths and interests to stand out as a candidate. Chikvaidze also encouraged students to remain focused on their goals and celebrate small victories alongside major achievements.

    "english_summary": "Researchers at NYU Langone have developed a new method that could help predict the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries. A study published in September from the NYU Grossman School of Medicine addresses the major challenge that CTE can currently only be diagnosed through an autopsy after death. The research team, led by Professor Hector Arciniega, used advanced computer analysis to compare brain scans from 169 former male football players against 54 males without a history of brain trauma. They found that former players had wider and shallower brain grooves, called sulci, which became more pronounced with longer athletic careers. According to Arciniega, this finding could enable a comprehensive risk assessment, marking a \"major shift in patient care\" by allowing for earlier intervention. Future research aims to explore how social factors might also affect CTE diagnosis and treatment.",

The results showed that 66% of participants who believed their sense of smell was unaffected post-COVID actually had abnormally low test scores, a condition known as hyposmia. Professor Horwitz noted that this impairment can lead to a loss of interest in eating and potential malnourishment. Crucially, it also poses safety risks, as individuals may fail to detect gas leaks, smoke from a fire, or spoiled food.

The research highlights that New York City, despite offering access to 74 of the specialties, has only 4.7 specialists per 1,000 residents. This shortage can result in longer wait times, bounced referrals, and an overreliance on primary care doctors for all residents, including students. The study identified addiction and preventive medicine as among the most underrepresented specialties in large metropolitan areas.
