    "english_summary": "Federal immigration enforcement operations will escalate in New York City, White House advisor Tom Homan announced, citing the city's sanctuary policies. Following this, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reappeared on Canal Street on Saturday, nearly a month after nine people were detained in the same area. While President Trump said he will not deploy the National Guard to the city, Homan warned of an increased enforcement presence. In other news impacting daily life, MTA officials reported that a wire thief was responsible for over 700 subway delays last month. The theft significantly disrupted evening rush hour service on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines. These developments occurred as President Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani held a \"productive meeting\" on Friday.",

During the session, part of the \"International Human Rights Activism and Education\" course, students asked how to secure work and internships at organizations like the UN. Chikvaidze acknowledged that the UN lacks a clear “docking point” for young people and accepts few undergraduate interns each year. He advised students to first understand the specific position they want, then build their candidacy by focusing on personal strengths and interests. Chikvaidze also urged students to celebrate small victories and not be deterred from their goals. He shared experiences from his work in humanitarian crises, stating his hope is to maximize the positive potential of youth, whom he called a “reservoir of talent, energy and enthusiasm.”",

    "english_summary": "Researchers at NYU Langone have discovered a method that could help predict the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries. This condition, common in athletes, is currently only diagnosable through a post-mortem autopsy. The September study was a collaboration between the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the Langone Concussion Center. Using advanced computer analysis, researchers compared the brain scans of 169 former male football players with those of 54 males without a history of head trauma. They found that former players had wider and shallower brain grooves, or sulci, with the difference being more pronounced the longer an individual had played. Lead author Hector Arciniega stated the goal is to develop a risk assessment to help physicians intervene before the disease worsens. Future research will also examine how social factors affect CTE diagnosis and treatment.",

    "english_summary": "A new study by researchers at NYU Langone Health reveals that a reduced sense of smell, or hyposmia, can persist for years after a COVID-19 infection, often without the person's awareness. The research, co-led by Grossman professor Leora Horwitz, surveyed over 3,500 people using a scratch-and-sniff test. A key finding was that while 80% of individuals who suspected smell loss were impaired, a surprising 66% of those who believed their sense of smell was normal also had abnormally low test scores. Horwitz warned that this impairment has serious daily life consequences, such as an inability to detect spoiled food, gas leaks, or smoke, and can lead to malnourishment from loss of interest in eating. While there are no concrete treatments, the study noted smell training can be beneficial. Researchers recommend formal screening for long-term COVID-19 patients, even those who do not report any symptoms.",

Based on data from over 1.4 million providers nationwide, the research highlighted that New York City has only 4.7 specialists per 1,000 residents. Researchers state this low ratio undermines care, especially for conditions common among older adults. According to lead author Tian Gan, a Tandon Ph.D. candidate, geriatric care providers like urology specialists scale particularly slowly. This trend leads to consequences for urban residents, including longer wait times, bounced referrals, and an overreliance on primary care. The study suggests these shortages may lead to \"medical tourism,\" requiring patients to travel for specialized care.",
