    "english_summary": "Federal immigration enforcement operations will escalate in New York City due to its sanctuary city policies, White House advisor Tom Homan announced on Tuesday. This follows the recent detention of nine people on Canal Street, where ICE agents reappeared on Saturday. However, President Trump stated he will not deploy the National Guard to assist, as they are needed more in other cities. This development occurred after a Friday meeting between President Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, where the two discussed city affairs. Separately, MTA officials reported on Wednesday that a thief stealing copper wires caused over 700 subway delays last month. The thefts, near the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station, disrupted the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines during evening rush hours.",

The talk was part of a course focused on migration this year. Responding to student questions about securing jobs and internships, Chikvaidze acknowledged that the UN accepts only a small number of undergraduate interns and lacks a clear entry point for young people. He advised students to first clearly identify their desired position and then learn how to emphasize the personal strengths and interests that make them a strong candidate. With 36 years of experience, Chikvaidze encouraged students to focus intently on their goals while also celebrating small victories along the way, calling youth a \"reservoir of talent, energy and enthusiasm.\"",

    "english_summary": "Researchers at NYU Langone have discovered a potential method to predict the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease from repeated head injuries that is currently only diagnosable after death. A September study from the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the Langone Concussion Center used advanced computer analysis on brain scans from 169 former male football players. The study found that these players had wider and shallower brain grooves (sulci) compared to 54 healthy males, a difference that increased with the length of their athletic careers. Lead author Professor Hector Arciniega stated this could enable a comprehensive risk assessment for living patients. This breakthrough represents a major shift from only treating symptoms to potentially intervening before the disease worsens. Future research will also explore how social factors impact CTE diagnosis and treatment.",

Researchers surveyed over 3,500 participants for nearly four years using a scratch-and-sniff test. The study found that a significant number of people who believed their sense of smell was normal after having COVID-19 actually had \"abnormally low\" scores. Specifically, of the patients who reported no issues, 66% were found to have a smelling deficiency, known as hyposmia. Co-lead author and Grossman professor Leora Horwitz warned that this unnoticed loss poses safety risks, such as the inability to detect gas leaks, smoke, or spoiled food, and can also lead to malnourishment. Researchers now recommend that doctors screen long-term COVID-19 patients with smell tests, even if they do not report any symptoms.",

This training method is particularly useful as it helps students build practical skills that are difficult to practice during internships due to patient confidentiality policies. The study was initiated in response to a 15.6% vacancy rate for mental health provider roles in the city. While students found the simulations helpful, many also felt anxious with automated feedback, indicating the technology requires further development.
