    "english_summary": "Federal immigration enforcement will escalate in New York City, White House advisor Tom Homan announced on Tuesday, specifically targeting the city’s sanctuary policies. This development follows an incident a month prior where nine people were detained on Canal Street, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents reappeared at the same location on Saturday. While President Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met on Friday, they did not address this issue, but Trump stated he would not deploy the National Guard to the city. Separately, students' commutes may be affected by subway issues, as MTA officials reported a copper wire thief caused over 700 delays last month. These disruptions primarily impacted the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines during evening rush hours. A 55-year-old suspect was arrested in connection with the thefts on October 14.",
