New York City’s LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark airports are among the list of 40 airports across the country experiencingmass cancellationsand delays. Six weeks into the government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — these complications are part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s effort to alleviate pressures on air traffic controllers.
The senate took itsfirst step toward ending the shutdownSunday night, but the spending bill will still need to pass the House before operations resume.
Federal officials announced that air travel will be reducedby 4%across the 40 busiest travel hubs in the United States, with cuts beginning on Friday and increasing to 10% next week. Nearly 4,000 delays and over 1,300 cancellations occurred across New York City’s three airports between Friday and Sunday.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said that easing complications from staff shortages to keep air travel safe was a main factor that drove these reductions. About 13,000 controllers and 50,000 TSA agents have been working without pay forover a month. Duffy said the FAA is still in need of an additional 2,000 air traffic controllers.
“We have more complaints from pilots about stress from air traffic controllers and more complaints about the lack of responsiveness from controllers,” Duffysaid Friday morning.
Other major airports affected include Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago O’Hare and San Francisco International airports. Duffy had told Fox News on Friday afternoon that if the shutdown did not end “relatively soon,” the agency would begin to see fewer controllers showing up to work, and cuts could potentiallyincrease to 20%.
Five alleged Brooklyn biker gang memberswere brought in front of a court, facing 52 charges including attempted murderin the shootingin East Flatbush in April, the district attorney said in a Thursday press release.
Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced that the five men were “variously charged” for attempted murder, criminal possession of a weapon, assault, criminal use of a firearm and reckless endangerment. Four of the defendants were arraigned on Wednesday before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Herbert Moses, though the last man’s arraignment is waiting to transfer the jurisdiction to his home state of New Jersey.
The shooting in East Flatbush, in which three individuals were shot and wounded, occurred while the defendants were hosting an event near Utica Avenue and Foster Avenue. Rival gang members drove past during the event, sparking a dispute that quickly escalated, damaging an occupied vehicle and causing bystanders nearby to flee.
Despite high profile cases across the city like the West Indian Day parade shooting inSeptemberand the Brooklyn Bar shooting inAugust, this year New York City has seen its fewest shooting incidents and shooting victimsin recorded history.
The defendants are set to return to court on Dec. 17.
Allies of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdanistarted an organizationto help fund his economic propositions, following his 8.8-point win inTuesday’s mayoral election.
Building on the momentum that Mamdani’s campaign generated,Our Time for NYC, Inc.hopes todeliver on his promisesto bring affordability to the city. Though not directly affiliated with the mayor-elect, the nonprofit has close ties to the Democratic Socialists of America’s New York chapter, and shares his values of free child care and buses, freezing the rent and building affordable homes.
SinceMamdani won, many havequestioned howhe will raise money and support for his ambitious goals — including securing billions in new income and corporate taxes. Though Gov. Kathy Hochul has alreadyexpressed supportfor Mamdani’s plans, his proposals will also require cooperation from the state government.
The nonprofit’s organizers said they will collaborate with community leaders, movement groups and unions to re-engage support. Executive Director Jeremy Freeman said the group will not accept corporate contributors — despite legally being able to accept unlimited contributions — and will disclose any donor who gives over $1,000 on their website.
“Our goal is to channel the energy of a volunteer base towards winning the affordability agenda,”  Freeman said. “Doing so at this scale is unprecedented in New York City history.”

Aviad Poznansky — known by his artist name, Aviad — grew up singing Jewish folk band Zusha’s “Yoel’s Niggun” atsummer camp. At 16, he decided to sample the track on a beat of his own and send it to Christo, a record producer, over Discord. The interaction led to Aviad’sbreakout moment: He was chosen to produce “Dance Now,” the second single on JID’s album “The Forever Story,” using the same sample.
In 2024, Aviad began studying at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, and he continues to develop his musical style across two albums and numerous collaborations. This includesproducingfor the likes of Chris Patrick and BROCKHAMPTON’s Merlyn Wood, while amassing millions of streams on solo releases like 2022’s “the best in me.” Following his performance at theGuggenheim Museum’s“Students First: Soundscape” event, Aviad spoke to WSN about his musical inspirations and the making of his EP “Cosmo’s Dream House,” which was released on Friday.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
WSN:What were some of the main stylistic influences behind your EP?
Aviad:When I was creating it, I was thinking deeply about releasing tension through movement. I was stuck in my head, so I thought of making something that can release everything I’m feeling through movement. I was really trying to respond to how my body would move to what I was creating. The overall tone of the album is pretty optimistic — I wanted to create something for myself that was uplifting and could take me out of what I was feeling at that moment.
I went to Japan for a week over the summer and was really inspired by the music there. I think they have a good sense of how to create happy music, and sometimes it can almost be overwhelmingly, absurdly happy.
WSN:Beyond those influences, ‘Cosmo’s Dream House’ still reflects the R&B-leaning sound of your previous releases, like 2023’s ‘undersensitized.’ How did this affect your approach to working with returning collaborators likeMiLESandYours Truly Nate?
Aviad:For ‘Spin The Clock,’ the song with Nate, I was definitely processing the vocals more like a sample, and the same with ARIEH’s vocals on ‘Baby GRL’ with Deante’ Hitchcock. The way I justified those shifts was that it was really congruent to the eclectic vibe of the album, and I was using my past collaborators’ vocals as additional texture to this project.
WSN:What are some of the key differences between the creative process for your own work and producing for other artists?
Aviad:My contribution to ‘Dance Now’ by JID was the four-bar sample that plays throughout the song, but I had no influence on the rest of the beat, like the drums or the 808 pattern. As abedroom producer, you don’t really have any say in what happens once your beat gets out. So the difference between that and what I’m doing now is that I can break free from what the artist puts down on my beat — I can just manipulate the parameters in a way that’s more true to my vision. At the end of the day, I’m the one who decides what comes out with the final product.
WSN:Who are some of your greatest musical inspirations?
Aviad:Throughout my career, I’ve always respected JPEGMAFIA. His approach to sampling and being himself in general has inspired me so much. I’ve always had a deep respect for hyperpop and industrial music artists like SOPHIE and Death Grips. I also feel like I’ve taken a lot from my collaborators likeKwame AduandDiz— I listen to their music often, and I’ve been so blessed to work with creative people with such unique voices that I don’t think I hear in a lot of popular music.
WSN:Are there any collaborations you’re excited to explore in the future?
Aviad:I’ve been working withOscar Scheller, who works really closely with PinkPantheress, Charli xcx and Bbyafricka — we had a really great studio session a week or two ago. I feel like the creative process that I figured out for myself on this EP is going to influence the way I work with other people in the future, and I could already see it taking shape while I was working with them. There’s also this artist,Ka$hkenni, who I’ve been working really closely with, and we’re going to release a music video soon that was directed by Grace Charles at NYU. She’s an amazing director, so I’m looking forward to that.

Over 70 professors and students across East Coast universities rallied outside a Midtown investment firm on Friday in protest of its owner’s contributions to President Donald Trump’s education compact, which financially incentivizes schools to meet his political demands.
The demonstration, organized by the American Association of University Professors, was one ofover 100 protests across U.S. campusesas part of the National Day of Action for Higher Education. AAUP members from NYU, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania gathered at the Apollo Global Management headquarters at 11 a.m., demanding that its CEO Marc Rowan — a Trump donor who helped author the education compact — refrain from making decisions that affect university policies.
Around six speakers began the protest by criticizing billionaires for turning colleges into “ideological battlegrounds,” while roughly 10 police officers surrounded the demonstration. They held signs reading “No Compact, No Loyalty Oath, No Oligarchs” while chanting “We need teachers, we need books! We need the money the billionaires took” before dispersing around 1 p.m. Earlier that week, Apollo sent letters to around 1,000 employees, advising them towork from homeahead of the demonstrations.
“We don’t want billionaires to put their hands on our institutions — and that would go for NYU as well,” CAS professor and AAUP member Andrew Ross told WSN. “You have no business tampering with our universities and posing your particular values.”
The protest comes just over a month after the Trump administration invited asmall group of universitiesto sign a compact that financially rewards those who end diversity hiring, freeze tuition for five years and cap international undergraduate enrollment at 15%. He opened it upto all universitiesless than two weeks later, andat least two collegeshave volunteered to sign the agreement so far.Seven of the nine collegesTrump initially contacted have rejected the compact.
In October, AAUP members held a town hall at NYU, calling for the university and other institutions topublicly denounce the compact. It also proposed that professors and students coordinate the “biggest mass-organizing event for higher education” in U.S. history on May Day 2026.
Rowan, a billionaire and Penn alum, contributed to ayearslong coalitionthat prompted Trump to sign an executive order in 2019 that classified “targeting of the state of Israel” as antisemitic, a move thatpredominantly targetedpro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. NYUadopted the definition in 2020as part of a settlement in an antisemitism case, and in 2024, updated its conduct guidelines to cite “code words, like ‘Zionist’” as a type of speech that could violate nondiscrimination policies.
Trump’s antisemitism task force said in March that it wouldinvestigate NYUand cut its funding if violations were found, although no apparent probe has taken place. On the day of the protest, Cornell University agreed topay $60 millionafter the Trump administration accused it of implementing diversity-related practices in admissions and university programming. As part of the settlement, Cornell will also survey its Jewish students annually on campus climate and safety.
“It’s clear that faculty, students and staff will continue to show up in ever larger numbers in order to defend the free pursuit of knowledge and advance a vision of higher-ed as a public good,” CAS professor and AAUP member David Markus told WSN. “Ultimately, administrators will need to decide whether they are committed to such a vision, or whether they are collaborators in the destruction of the institutions.”
Over a dozen students from NYU’s chapter of Students for a Democratic Society also organized a walkoutFriday at noon, demanding that the university explicitly reject the compact and end its “compliance with the Trump administration.” They also criticized NYU Langone Health’s decision todeny gender-affirming careto two transgender patients following Trump’s first wave of executive orders in January.
“NYU will do anything to please the current administration because the university continues to be motivated by profit over people,” SDS said in a statement. “If NYU’s leadership doesn’t stand up to this compact, then they will cement the university’s position in history: As fascism crept into higher education, NYU was too cowardly to take a stand.”

Stern researchersfoundthat despite a projected decline in globalization and slowed U.S. trade growth, most countries have yet to make significant changes to their trading patterns amid a slew of tariffs from President Donald Trump.
The business school’s findings were part of itsDHL Initiative on Globalization, a collaboration between international logistics company DHL and the Stern School of Business’s Center for the Future of Management. The tracker is updated as new information comes out and typically releases a report in late November, although this edition was around one month early in response to Trump’s tariff push.
Evaluating more than 20 million data points, researchers predicted in 2024 that global trade volume would increase by 3.1% between 2025 and 2029, but their expectation slumped to 2.5% after Trump announced plans to scale tariffs. Trade growth projections from January to September fell slightly across nearly all countries — other than those in Central and South America, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region. North America’s projected growth saw the sharpest decline, dropping from 2.7% to 1.5%.
“In an environment where discussions around globalization are often shaped more by sentiment than substance, our joint commitment to empirical evidence is crucial,” Sabine Hartmann, DHL spokesperson said in a statement to WSN. “Facts — not feelings — must form the foundation of effective trade and policy decisions.”
While many countries were minimally affected by shifting trade policy overall, the tracker emphasized an accelerating drop in trade ties between the United States and China. U.S. imports from China fell from 13% in 2024 to 9% in the last seven months, while China has substantially retreated from exporting to the United States — instead redirecting focus toward exporting products to Southeast Asian and European markets, offsetting the decline with a 15%increase.
“Nonetheless, falling U.S.-China trade is not indicative of a global pullback from trade,” Caroline Bastian, a researcherat NYU Stern’s DHL Initiative on Globalization said.“Global trade volumes are still expected to grow as fast over the next five years as they did during the past decade.”
The report in fact found that U.S. global trade grew faster than in any half-year since 2010, with the exception of a brief spell during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was largely attributed to people preemptively frontloading purchases and U.S. imports have been on the decline since June, but most other countries have been minimally impacted. DHL’s Global Connectedness Index — which measures globalization based on trade and information flow, among 12 other metrics — reached a record high in 2022 and has remained steady since.
Since taking office in January, Trump has made efforts to limit trade with China by issuing several rounds of tariffs of up to 145%, targeting key commodities such as rare minerals, pharmaceuticals and energy products. Earlier this month, the United States announced that it will reduce the cumulative tariff rate in place to pressure China into mitigating fentanyl trafficking, from 20% to 10% — a policy that will take effect Monday, Nov. 10.
In an email statement to WSN, Steven Altman, who directs Stern’s DHL initiative, said the project aims to dispel misconceptions that globalization is reversing and countries increasingly are decoupled from international trade. He said the tracker analyzes tangible, geographical trade patterns to capture real-time effects of policy changes, distinguishing it from other publications that focus on macro-level consumer preferences.
“Globalization can be a controversial topic, and research shows that people often have misperceptions about it,” Altman said. “So, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to find accurate and timely data about levels and patterns of globalization.”

“Nonetheless, falling U.S.-China trade is not indicative of a global pullback from trade,” Caroline Bastian, a researcherat NYU Stern’s DHL Initiative on Globalization said.“Global trade volumes are still expected to grow as fast over the next five years as they did during the past decade.”
The report in fact found that U.S. global trade grew faster than in any half-year since 2010, with the exception of a brief spell during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was largely attributed to people preemptively frontloading purchases and U.S. imports have been on the decline since June, but most other countries have been minimally impacted. DHL’s Global Connectedness Index — which measures globalization based on trade and information flow, among 12 other metrics — reached a record high in 2022 and has remained steady since.
Since taking office in January, Trump has made efforts to limit trade with China by issuing several rounds of tariffs of up to 145%, targeting key commodities such as rare minerals, pharmaceuticals and energy products. Earlier this month, the United States announced that it will reduce the cumulative tariff rate in place to pressure China into mitigating fentanyl trafficking, from 20% to 10% — a policy that will take effect Monday, Nov. 10.
In an email statement to WSN, Steven Altman, who directs Stern’s DHL initiative, said the project aims to dispel misconceptions that globalization is reversing and countries increasingly are decoupled from international trade. He said the tracker analyzes tangible, geographical trade patterns to capture real-time effects of policy changes, distinguishing it from other publications that focus on macro-level consumer preferences.
“Globalization can be a controversial topic, and research shows that people often have misperceptions about it,” Altman said. “So, we want to make it as easy as possible for people to find accurate and timely data about levels and patterns of globalization.”

'''
Researchers at NYU's Stern School of Business have found that despite talk of deglobalization, global trade patterns remain largely unchanged for most countries. The study, part of the DHL Initiative on Globalization, was released early in response to tariffs from President Donald Trump. It highlights an accelerating drop in trade between the United States and China, with U.S. imports from China falling from 13% in 2024 to 9% in the last seven months. In response, China has redirected its focus, increasing exports to Southeast Asian and European markets by 15%. Since January, the Trump administration has issued tariffs up to 145% on key Chinese products. However, a cumulative tariff rate is set to be reduced from 20% to 10% on November 10. Despite these specific tensions, the Stern researchers concluded that global trade is still expected to grow, countering notions of a broad reversal of globalization.

NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering launched theUrban Instituteearlier this month, aiming to synthesize researchers’ efforts to create more accessible city design and mitigate the effects of natural disasters through advanced technology.
As cities around the world see growing populations, the institute, led by Tandon Dean Juan de Pablo, will primarily focus on climate, public health and city infrastructure, using artificial intelligence and data science to build urban planning tools. The institute is in the process of establishing “4+1” curricula, which would allow students to earn both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in five years.
“Our primary goal is to unite multiple academic disciplines across NYU to conduct research, educate the next generation of urban scholars and develop scientifically validated solutions for a future built around urban living,” Maurizio Porfiri, the institute’s inaugural director, said in a statement to WSN. “We are in the very early stages of discussions between the Center for Urban Science and Progress and the Civil and Urban Engineering department at Tandon to chart the future of the institute.”
Porfiri said that the initiative will focus on four areas of research — physical infrastructure, the natural environment, urban systems and the science of cities — partnering with community organizations and city governments to deepen their impact. Researchers will monitor urban flooding and scale traffic patterns to improve safety measures for construction workers.
The Urban Institute launch follows NYU’s announcement of a newInstitute for Engineering Health, a Tandon and NYU Langone Health collaboration combining the fields of policy, engineering and health science to offer two new master’s degrees in Emerging Technology and Quantum Science and Technology.

After more than a decade at NYU, Chief Research Officer Stacie Bloom will step down in January toserve as president and CEOof the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation — a not-for-profit that disperses 200 research grants annually and gave NYU $1.2 million in research funding last year.
Bloom joined NYU in 2011 as the inaugural executive director for NYU Langone Health’s Neuroscience Institute, before becoming the university’s chief research officer and vice provost for research in 2018. During her tenure, Bloom oversaw the NYU’s rise to thetop university for research spendingin New York state and No. 12 nationally — up from No. 3 and No. 24, respectively — as well as its response to a federal crackdown on research.
Bloom spoke with WSN about how her time at NYU brought her to lead the Sloan Foundation president and what she hopes to accomplish in the position.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
WSN:How might your higher education experience contribute to the new role?
Bloom:A lot of the skills that I picked up here are really transferable. So being very strategic, being a good manager and being a good listener to stakeholders in our community are all things that are really important. But the most important thing is being a champion for science and for research. There are a lot of things that are going to be very different about leaving an institute of higher education and going to a foundation. Overall, it’s just an interesting time to lead through so much change.
Before joining NYU, Bloom served as vice president and scientific director at the New York Academy of Sciences from 2005 to 2011, and had previously worked as an associate editor for Nature Medicine. As chief research officer and vice provost for research, Bloom managed NYU’s research strategies, including its policies, partnerships and grant portfolio. In 2024,25 NYU facultyacross science, engineering and math were named among the world’s most cited researchers.
WSN:What do you enjoy about working at NYU?
Bloom:It’s going to be really hard to leave NYU. I really love our research community and my team. We have an amazingly large research community, and a big part of what we try to do is get that research out of the university and into society. But I’ve taken a lot of comfort knowing that the Sloan Foundation and NYU have a really longstanding relationship. So I’m really excited that the link will still be there.
The Sloan Foundation offersgrants to support original researchand education related to science, engineering, technology, mathematics and economics. It providednearly $700,000to Tisch students who created films about science and technology last year, as well asover $500,000in grants for scientific and historical research.
WSN:How did you get in touch with Sloan Foundation?
Bloom:I was contacted back in the summer by the firm because they wanted to hire a new president and CEO, and as soon as I got the phone call, I was so excited. This is a dream job. Through the interview process, I really realized that this next step represents the culmination of everything I’ve done in my career. It brings together all of my experience in science, in technology, in research, leadership and innovation and gives me that next step on the ladder.
Its Tisch-focused grant offers a $30,000 production grant and three $10,000 screenwriting awards, whose applicants are also eligible for a $20,000 Sloan Grand Jury Prize and a year of mentorship.
Since 2008,10 NYU Tisch studentshave received the Sloan Foundation Feature Film Award, which is given to projects that focus on science and technology or involve a scientist or engineer as a major character. These works range from graduate films about using reality to mend a broken family to undergraduate films about a mysterious illness.
WSN:What do you hope to achieve in your new role?
Bloom:So many things. Working really closely with their staff and with our board to really sustain their unmatched legacy. The foundation has an incredibly rich history, and my job is to steward and honor that history. It has an incredible legacy of funding original research, and we need that more than ever. It’s important to support really talented people who are working on curiosity-driven questions that really could have a major impact on societal challenges and on important fields.

Bloom:I was contacted back in the summer by the firm because they wanted to hire a new president and CEO, and as soon as I got the phone call, I was so excited. This is a dream job. Through the interview process, I really realized that this next step represents the culmination of everything I’ve done in my career. It brings together all of my experience in science, in technology, in research, leadership and innovation and gives me that next step on the ladder.
Its Tisch-focused grant offers a $30,000 production grant and three $10,000 screenwriting awards, whose applicants are also eligible for a $20,000 Sloan Grand Jury Prize and a year of mentorship.
Since 2008,10 NYU Tisch studentshave received the Sloan Foundation Feature Film Award, which is given to projects that focus on science and technology or involve a scientist or engineer as a major character. These works range from graduate films about using reality to mend a broken family to undergraduate films about a mysterious illness.
WSN:What do you hope to achieve in your new role?
Bloom:So many things. Working really closely with their staff and with our board to really sustain their unmatched legacy. The foundation has an incredibly rich history, and my job is to steward and honor that history. It has an incredible legacy of funding original research, and we need that more than ever. It’s important to support really talented people who are working on curiosity-driven questions that really could have a major impact on societal challenges and on important fields.

'''
Stacie Bloom, New York University’s Chief Research Officer and Vice Provost for Research, will step down in January to lead the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation as its new president and CEO. During her tenure, Bloom helped elevate NYU's research spending to No. 1 in New York state and No. 12 nationally. The move is significant for students as the Sloan Foundation has a strong funding relationship with NYU, providing the university with $1.2 million in research funding last year. The foundation offers grants to support original research and education in key fields including science, engineering, technology, mathematics, and economics. Specifically for students, it provided nearly $700,000 to Tisch students for films on science and technology and over $500,000 for other research grants last year. These opportunities include a $30,000 production grant and multiple screenwriting awards, and Bloom noted she is excited that the link between the foundation and NYU will remain strong.

Stern researchers found that extremists across the political spectrum often use high-profile incidents tocreate divisivenesson social media platforms and perpetuate violent rhetoric. The report, released last month, found that they take advantage of algorithms and privacy features on platforms such as Telegram and X to optimize reach without heavy moderation.
Researchers worked with Tech Against Terrorism — an independent organization launched by the United Nations to fight online violence — to monitor online activity from March to June, specifically focusing on communities they deemed “far-right, far-left, violent Islamist, and nihilistic violent extremist.” Stern policy adviser Mariana Olaizola Rosenblat and senior research scientist Luke Barnes, who authored the report, focused on how extremist groups could use unique algorithms to better target individual users and lead them toward holding more polarized and often violent views.
“The algorithmic ability to fashion your own ideology makes it a lot easier to, as a former FBI director mentioned, come up with your own salad bar of extremism,” Barnes said. “So you want a little bit of the far right, you want a bit of the far left, you want a bit of something completely esoteric — that’s much, much more possible nowadays than it was even 10 years ago.”
One of their main findings was that extremist groups strategically vary their content across different platforms. They use mainstream apps like Instagram, TikTok or X, then direct users to encrypted platforms such as Signal, Discord or Telegram, where they can share content with minimal moderation.
However, Barnes noted that those apps can also serve as means to rally for “pro-democracy protests” in places where organizers’ identities and safety may be at risk. Because of this, it’s challenging to suggest drafting regulations that don’t infringe upon free speech concerns. He also mentioned that X, one of the more public platforms they monitored, was mainly used to sway others toward a certain political ideology due to its high viewer engagement.
“You can’t solve the problems of digital harms by trying to ban every digital harm,” Barnes said. “But at the same time, that high threshold for threats and terroristic content that the United States has — it results in a lot of hate speech. It results in a lot of doxxing, of malicious activity online.”
Rosenblat said that because TAT’s strict policy prevents analysts from interacting with users, she was unable to access certain encrypted groups and instead gathered data in the aftermath of acts of violence.
Researchers also found that extremist groups are most active — and often most effective — following high-profile acts of violence, especially those with political undertones. Appealing to preexisting narratives, the groups can exploit heightened emotions to scale the impact of violent incidents. The report comes months after the assassination of former Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as prominent right-wing figure Charlie Kirk, amid rising political violence and polarization in the United States.
The report recommends that social media platforms more precisely define threats, make it easier for users to report violent conduct and responsibly collect data to flag potentially dangerous users. It also suggested that policymakers create a distinction between protected speech and illegal terrorist threats, draft guidelines for the type of information that social media platforms can share and support research that counteracts violent narratives.
“Every platform has to strike a balance, and governments too, in the regulations between privacy, freedom of speech and safety,” Rosenblat told WSN. “But each platform should have a responsibility to moderate or mitigate against harm.”

Researchers from New York University’s Stern School of Business have released a report detailing how extremist groups across the political spectrum use social media to promote division and violent rhetoric. The study, authored by Mariana Olaizola Rosenblat and Luke Barnes, found that these groups exploit algorithms and privacy features on platforms like X and Telegram. They often use mainstream apps such as Instagram and TikTok to redirect users to encrypted platforms like Signal or Discord, where content has minimal moderation. The report notes this activity intensifies following high-profile violent events, capitalizing on heightened emotions amid rising political polarization in the United States. Researchers highlighted the difficulty of creating regulations that do not infringe upon free speech, noting the U.S. legal standard allows significant hate speech and malicious online activity. The report recommends that platforms better define threats and that policymakers distinguish between protected speech and illegal terrorist content.

As New Yorkers bundle up for winter a couple weeks after a chilly Halloweekend, costume stores around the city die down. But at the Tisch School of the Arts’ Production and Design Studio, a cadre of Drama students continue to shop for unique ensembles year-round, quietly sewingthe backbone of entertainment together.
During their sophomore year, Production and Design students choose to concentrate in two of five core disciplines, one of which is costume design. The studio aims to equip students with the stage management skills and experience working on production sets necessary to become costumers in the theater industry.
One of only a handful of seniors in the concentration, Tisch student Nina Ganyard initially pursued sound and stage management before a professor guided her toward costuming. According to Ganyard, costume design is key to making a statement with a play, even if implicitly.
“Even if you’re not paying attention to it, it still tells you about that person,” Ganyard said. “In regular life, you can tell if someone has a lot of money because of the type of clothes they wear, even if you don’t realize that that’s what you’re thinking.”
Costume design, like other parts of technical theater, plays a supporting role to actors and playwrights. However, Ganyard sees a common misconception that costume design is simpler or less labor intensive than similar fields.
“When talking to people who aren’t super in the theater world, they see sound design as something really cool,” Ganyard said. “It’s basically engineering. It’s fancy and magical, and then costume design is, ‘Oh, you’re putting clothes on people?’”
Seo Yun, a senior in the studio with concentrations in costume and scenic design, said that the battle for recognition is coupled with financial struggles.More than 80%of costume designers are female, and typically bring in 30% less pay than other designers in a production.
“Fashion, clothes and sewing are, historically and still even now, a heavily gendered part of the theater world — and therefore considered not as important or materially real as carpentry or sound,” Yun said.
Designers like Yun — who is currently working for an upcoming play at The Tank, a black box theater in Midtown — test out multiple renditions for their costumes, while balancing their designs with the personalities of the performers who wear them. Most of the physical work of a costume designer, however, happens at clothing stores, where they shop for and return pieces.
“You’re most often on your feet doing what I call mule work,” Yun said. “Which is when you bounce back and forth between different places in Midtown, looking for fabric swatches and costume pieces in thrift shops.”
When costume design is done right, Yun said that it permeates viewers’ perception of a play, even if only a niche community of designers and enthusiasts can see it.
“The real beauty of costume design comes from when it’s imperceptible — it informs so much of your experience with the show, even if you can’t really pinpoint it,” Yun said. “It’s a way of building the world. It’s a way of communicating who these characters are in more ineffable ways.”
Outside of the dressing room, most of the unglamorous work consists of paperwork and meetings. For Yun, it’s a labor of love — especially because designers are often out of the spotlight, forming bonds with actors through the transformative ability of a costume makes the job worth it.
“As soon as an actor puts a costume piece on, when you can tell that actor feels hot and good in a costume piece, you can really tell through their body language, through how they’re existing in space,” Yun said. “The way they walk, the way they talk, even the way their head and eyes change. It’s really magical to see when something that you designed becomes a person.”

But at the Tisch School of the Arts’ Production and Design Studio, a cadre of Drama students continue to shop for unique ensembles year-round, quietly sewingthe backbone of entertainment together.
During their sophomore year, Production and Design students choose to concentrate in two of five core disciplines, one of which is costume design. The studio aims to equip students with the stage management skills and experience working on production sets necessary to become costumers in the theater industry.
One of only a handful of seniors in the concentration, Tisch student Nina Ganyard initially pursued sound and stage management before a professor guided her toward costuming. According to Ganyard, costume design is key to making a statement with a play, even if implicitly.
“Even if you’re not paying attention to it, it still tells you about that person,” Ganyard said. “In regular life, you can tell if someone has a lot of money because of the type of clothes they wear, even if you don’t realize that that’s what you’re thinking.”
Costume design, like other parts of technical theater, plays a supporting role to actors and playwrights. However, Ganyard sees a common misconception that costume design is simpler or less labor intensive than similar fields.
“When talking to people who aren’t super in the theater world, they see sound design as something really cool,” Ganyard said. “It’s basically engineering. It’s fancy and magical, and then costume design is, ‘Oh, you’re putting clothes on people?’”
Seo Yun, a senior in the studio with concentrations in costume and scenic design, said that the battle for recognition is coupled with financial struggles.More than 80%of costume designers are female, and typically bring in 30% less pay than other designers in a production.
“Fashion, clothes and sewing are, historically and still even now, a heavily gendered part of the theater world — and therefore considered not as important or materially real as carpentry or sound,” Yun said.
Designers like Yun — who is currently working for an upcoming play at The Tank, a black box theater in Midtown — test out multiple renditions for their costumes, while balancing their designs with the personalities of the performers who wear them. Most of the physical work of a costume designer, however, happens at clothing stores, where they shop for and return pieces.
“You’re most often on your feet doing what I call mule work,” Yun said. “Which is when you bounce back and forth between different places in Midtown, looking for fabric swatches and costume pieces in thrift shops.”
When costume design is done right, Yun said that it permeates viewers’ perception of a play, even if only a niche community of designers and enthusiasts can see it.
“The real beauty of costume design comes from when it’s imperceptible — it informs so much of your experience with the show, even if you can’t really pinpoint it,” Yun said. “It’s a way of building the world. It’s a way of communicating who these characters are in more ineffable ways.”
Outside of the dressing room, most of the unglamorous work consists of paperwork and meetings. For Yun, it’s a labor of love — especially because designers are often out of the spotlight, forming bonds with actors through the transformative ability of a costume makes the job worth it.
“As soon as an actor puts a costume piece on, when you can tell that actor feels hot and good in a costume piece, you can really tell through their body language, through how they’re existing in space,” Yun said. “The way they walk, the way they talk, even the way their head and eyes change. It’s really magical to see when something that you designed becomes a person.”

'''
At New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, students in the costume design concentration are learning the realities of a demanding and often undervalued profession. Seo Yun, a senior in the Production and Design studio, highlights that costume design is frequently perceived as a "heavily gendered" and less critical field within theater. This view contributes to significant financial struggles; over 80% of costume designers are female, and they typically earn 30% less than other designers on a production. Yun describes the daily tasks as demanding "mule work," which involves searching for materials in thrift shops and fabric stores across Midtown. Despite the lack of glamour and recognition, she finds deep satisfaction when a costume helps an actor fully embody a character. The program aims to prepare students for these industry challenges by providing direct experience on production sets.

The biannual debate between NYU’s College Democrats and College Republicans, initially slated for Wednesday, was indefinitely postponed after the former raised concerns about “verbal attacks” at a recent club meeting.
Representatives from the Politics Society, which organizes the debate, told WSN that they were not informed of the decision until Monday night. NYU spokesperson John Beckman said in an email statement that the debate was temporarily canceled after a student organization notified the university of its concerns surrounding “interfering events.”
“After some discussion with the group, the Center for Student Life suggested that it was best to delay the debate to work through some of those issues,” Beckman said. “The Center for Student Life has reached out to all parties in hopes that the issues can be ironed out and with the expectation that debate will go forward soon.”
Gallatin senior and College Democrats President Mikala Gruber told WSN in a statement that the group raised safety concerns to the university after its meetings were interrupted by members of the College Republicans. She added that some students faced harassment after the College Republicans issued a “non-consensual”social media poston the same day.
The post featured an image of CAS junior and College Republicans President Ryan Leonard and a member of the College Democrats in a classroom. Its caption said that although NYU is “such a democrat-ridden school,” only “FOUR PEOPLE had shown up” to the College Democrats’ meeting.
“We have serious concerns about the current Republican club’s actions,” Gruber said. “No meaningful exchange of ideas can happen in an environment where students feel unsafe or at risk of harassment.”
In an interview with WSN, Leonard said that a member of the Politics Society told him the debate was postponed Monday night, but did not specify the reason.
“It just seems like it’s discrimination against political speech,” Leonard said.
Ahead of the debate, both clubs received a list of debate topics from the Politics Society. The debate was set to focus on U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again initiative, President Donald Trump’s deployments of the National Guard and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s city reform plans.
Leonard said the College Democrats “weren’t really happy” with the topics and changed them after an initial round of reviews — claiming that his club was not offered the same opportunity. Gruber said that the Politics Society has the most say over debate questions and did not elaborate on her club’s involvement in the preparation.
“I think they’re kind of intimidated by our extreme popularity, and just like how everyone loves us,” Leonard said.
Last fall,the biannual debatesaw three representatives from each club discussing themes such as the economy, gun control and voter registration. For its most recent debate in March, the Politics Society told WSN that it intentionally encouraged the clubs to choose more “politically neutral” debate themes, landing on heightened tariffs, the Russia-Ukraine war and law enforcement on the subway.
Last month, NYU Lawpostponedan Oct. 7 panel — which featured a pro-Israel speaker and was hosted by the school’s chapter of the Federalist Society — due to “security concerns.” The event wasreinstatedhours after the law school was criticized for “censorship” by at least two free speech watchdog organizations. AnotherCollege Republicans panelwas canceled by NYU last semester after a guest speaker requested armed security at the event.
“We are continuing to work with the university and stand ready to debate anyone who is acting in good faith,” Gruber said.

Steinhardt researchers found that more students receive referrals and suspensions at secondary schools withhigher teacher turnover, with students from racial minorities affected at a notably higher rate.
The September study — which analyzed data including disciplinary records, teacher resignations and classroom demographics in grades six through 12 across New York City Public Schools from 2011 to 2022 — identified a strong correlation between teacher resignations and student suspensions. Researchers inferred that schools might worsen turnover rates by not providing sufficient support for teachers to manage student behaviors, an area that many teachers struggle with, according to lead author and Steinhardt professor Luis Rodriguez.
“Providing that extra support could help new teachers as they acclimate to a new school environment and to the profession in general,” Rodriguez told WSN. “That could reduce the likelihood that teachers will be inclined to want to leave the field.”
Researchers found that a 13.3% decrease in teacher departures at the end of an academic year correlated with 5.7% fewer students receiving disciplinary referrals and 7.2% fewer student suspensions. Students also appeared to be affected when teachers leave in the middle of the year, with a 4.5% decrease in mid-year departures correlating with 2.4% fewer student suspensions. Students were most affected when longtime teachers left — suspensions and disciplinary referrals increased by an average of 20 to 30% for each year of experience a teacher had before departing mid-year.
Students of underrepresented racial backgrounds were more likely to face disciplinary action at almost any point across the 11 years analyzed. Black students received office referrals at a rate 1.4 to 1.6 times higher than the general study population, and were suspended at a similarly higher rate during any given year.
Researchers recommended that schools address racial disparities by implementing anti-bias training and policies that could promote equitable disciplinary practices, as well as reduce turnover by establishing mentorship programs for teachers. Going forward, they hope to measure how turnover rates can influence communication between schools and parents.
“We don’t necessarily see it as a reflection of anything the school district is doing wrong,” Rodriguez said. “These are issues that all school districts face, but we hope that our study points attention to why turnover might matter beyond just achievement.”

Steinhardt researchers found that more students receive referrals and suspensions at secondary schools withhigher teacher turnover, with students from racial minorities affected at a notably higher rate.
The September study — which analyzed data including disciplinary records, teacher resignations and classroom demographics in grades six through 12 across New York City Public Schools from 2011 to 2022 — identified a strong correlation between teacher resignations and student suspensions. Researchers inferred that schools might worsen turnover rates by not providing sufficient support for teachers to manage student behaviors, an area that many teachers struggle with, according to lead author and Steinhardt professor Luis Rodriguez.
“Providing that extra support could help new teachers as they acclimate to a new school environment and to the profession in general,” Rodriguez told WSN. “That could reduce the likelihood that teachers will be inclined to want to leave the field.”
Researchers found that a 13.3% decrease in teacher departures at the end of an academic year correlated with 5.7% fewer students receiving disciplinary referrals and 7.2% fewer student suspensions. Students also appeared to be affected when teachers leave in the middle of the year, with a 4.5% decrease in mid-year departures correlating with 2.4% fewer student suspensions. Students were most affected when longtime teachers left — suspensions and disciplinary referrals increased by an average of 20 to 30% for each year of experience a teacher had before departing mid-year.
Students of underrepresented racial backgrounds were more likely to face disciplinary action at almost any point across the 11 years analyzed. Black students received office referrals at a rate 1.4 to 1.6 times higher than the general study population, and were suspended at a similarly higher rate during any given year.
Researchers recommended that schools address racial disparities by implementing anti-bias training and policies that could promote equitable disciplinary practices, as well as reduce turnover by establishing mentorship programs for teachers. Going forward, they hope to measure how turnover rates can influence communication between schools and parents.
“We don’t necessarily see it as a reflection of anything the school district is doing wrong,” Rodriguez said. “These are issues that all school districts face, but we hope that our study points attention to why turnover might matter beyond just achievement.”

Scientists at NYU’s Department of Environmental Studies discovered an untapped potential among “grassy trees” — such as bamboo, banana and palm trees — to help ecosystems respond to climate change and recover from damage.
TheOctober reportanalyzed data across 12 ecosystem types and identified grassy trees — known for growing quickly, like grass, while having a “tree-like canopy dominance” — as a way to restore climate-related damage. Unlike previous research that has notably overlooked these types of plants, the new grassy trees specification is vital to discovering more about how these plants offer natural “solutions for sustainability.”
“It’s a weird case where you can’t neatly classify them,” Aiyu Zheng, lead author of the study, told WSN. “When people survey forests, if they see palms or bamboos, they either get excluded from the survey or included as a separate category. It isn’t very consistent, and for doing large scale science analysis, you need consistent metrics and methods.”
The roles of these trees can vary depending on the context, region or ecosystem. The study highlighted the plants’ importance in generating income, food and exports for rural communities while remaining eco-friendly.
In many African countries where bamboo is a natural part of the ecosystem, there are regions suffering from reduced levels of farmland fertility — but planting bamboo wasproven to helprestore those issues while generating income. Banana trees shade gardens in Southeast Asia, supplying food and supporting incomes, and South Africa’s wetland biodiversity is sustained by its moriche palm.
“This work we published tried to showcase a lot of versatile aspects we could use them for, like solving plastic waste issues,” Zheng said. “They’re just a good thing and already working for so many places in the tropics, and what we do is simply put that together and showcase a story.”
Grassy trees are unique because they grow faster — consequently taking out carbon faster — and they are resilient to external disturbances. When storms hit coastal tropical regions, palm trees would be thefirst to grow backwhile helping reshape destroyed landscape.
“They’re just a good thing and already working for so many places in the tropics,” Zheng said. “What we do is simply put that together and showcase a story.”

Faculty accused of discriminatory conduct can now have an attorney present during investigations, marking a step forward in faculty senators’ ongoing push to ensure fairness throughout conduct proceedings.
Effective since last Thursday, Provost Georgina Dopico agreed to aproposalthat allows all accused faculty to have a legal aide present when they meet with the Office of Equal Opportunity, the department that investigates discrimination complaints. The policy change comes after three years of proposals from NYU’s Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council, as well as more recent support from the Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty Senators Council.
“We’re not trying to get anybody off the hook if they did something bad,”Global Public Health professor andC-FSC chair Chris Dickey told WSN. “We really are trying to make sure that everybody has a fair shot at defending themselves.”
In a statement to WSN, NYU spokesperson John Beckman said the issue has been “fully addressed.”
The senator’s council is still urging administrators to publicly disclose and expand the respondent’s rights in discrimination and harassment cases. This would prospectively include sharing written statements detailing their alleged misconduct, disclosing evidence and reason for guilty finding, and more clearly guiding them through the response and appeals process.
Heidi White, a Liberal Studies professor and C-FSC member, told WSN that she has been the one to tell faculty that they can appeal OEO decisions because they wouldn’t have otherwise known. She added that at least one faculty member accused of violating the NDAH policy was asked to sign “an acknowledgement of guilt,” — despite having insisted that they were innocent and receiving little notice from NYU.
“Merely offering private statements to senators, or claiming to adhere to procedures that no one can publicly verify, is meaningless,” White said. “If a person is wrongly accused, do they have to wait till they run into a faculty senator on the street, maybe years later, before they know what rights they might have had?”
NYU’snew complaint guidelinesstipulate that respondents are made aware of “the nature of the allegations made against them” as well as the “relevant section of the policy” prior to their meetings with the OEO. They also say respondents are “advised to review” NYU’s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policy to prepare for the investigation.
PreviousNDAH complaint guidelines— which cover responses to conduct based on race, gender and religion, among other identities — add that the OEO will “maintain the confidentiality of the complaint” and will not tolerate any form of retaliation. Both parties have the right to union representation during the investigation if they are members of one, and are interviewed separately during the process.
“We definitely don’t want people to feel like they don’t have the ability to raise a complaint if somebody is behaving improperly,” Dickey told WSN. “But we also want an environment that’s fair for everyone, including the people who are being accused.”
C-FSC submitted its first resolution to Dopico inMay 2022. Over a year later, the OEO’s former director agreed to notify respondents of the evidence and reasoning behind their case, but the development was reportedly never posted to the OEO’s website. InAprilandNovember 2024, the T-FSC sent two letters to Docipo comparing the procedures at NYU to those at Columbia University, citing that the latter has an “84-page document that covers in fine detail matters of process and the rights of the parties.” In April 2025, the C-FSC sent asecond resolutionto the provost with the same requests.
“It’s in everyone’s interest to have a fair and transparent system,” White said. “A false accusation can ruin a professor’s career, and it can ruin a dean’s career, a staff member’s career — anybody’s career. The academic community as a whole has a powerful interest in setting this right.”

NYU’snew complaint guidelinesstipulate that respondents are made aware of “the nature of the allegations made against them” as well as the “relevant section of the policy” prior to their meetings with the OEO. They also say respondents are “advised to review” NYU’s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policy to prepare for the investigation.
PreviousNDAH complaint guidelines— which cover responses to conduct based on race, gender and religion, among other identities — add that the OEO will “maintain the confidentiality of the complaint” and will not tolerate any form of retaliation. Both parties have the right to union representation during the investigation if they are members of one, and are interviewed separately during the process.
“We definitely don’t want people to feel like they don’t have the ability to raise a complaint if somebody is behaving improperly,” Dickey told WSN. “But we also want an environment that’s fair for everyone, including the people who are being accused.”
C-FSC submitted its first resolution to Dopico inMay 2022. Over a year later, the OEO’s former director agreed to notify respondents of the evidence and reasoning behind their case, but the development was reportedly never posted to the OEO’s website. InAprilandNovember 2024, the T-FSC sent two letters to Docipo comparing the procedures at NYU to those at Columbia University, citing that the latter has an “84-page document that covers in fine detail matters of process and the rights of the parties.” In April 2025, the C-FSC sent asecond resolutionto the provost with the same requests.
“It’s in everyone’s interest to have a fair and transparent system,” White said. “A false accusation can ruin a professor’s career, and it can ruin a dean’s career, a staff member’s career — anybody’s career. The academic community as a whole has a powerful interest in setting this right.”

原始英文摘要（用于翻译）：
'''
New York University has updated its policy to permit faculty accused of discrimination to have legal representation present during investigations. Effective last week, the change was approved by Provost Georgina Dopico following a three-year campaign by faculty senator councils to ensure fairer conduct proceedings. These investigations are handled by the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) under NYU’s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policy, which covers complaints based on race, gender, and religion, among other identities. According to new guidelines, accused individuals will now be informed of the allegations' nature before meeting with the OEO. While this marks a step toward increased rights for the accused, faculty senators are still advocating for greater transparency, such as requiring the university to share written evidence with respondents. Proponents emphasize the goal is to provide a fair defense for all, not to excuse misconduct.

With a punchline-heavy style, comedian Sam Morril is not afraid to poke fun at his personal blunders or air out awkward encounters during comedy sets. His self-depreciating style is prevalent in his recent “The Errors Tour” and past specials — “Same Time Tomorrow,” on Netflix, and “You’ve Changed” on Prime Video — showcasing how he uses vulnerability to connect with audiences.
But long before his mainstream success, Morril struggled to launch his stand-up career in New Orleans while attending Tulane University. That was until he returned to his native New York City in 2007, transferring to NYU to study Ancient Greek comedy — all while frequenting comedy bars in the city.
Morril spoke to WSN about his journey building rapport in the comedy scene and his advice on crafting a career in the creative field.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
WSN: What were your early days as a comic like?
Morril: I was horrible. The first time I went up was an open mic, and it was embarrassing. I knew I was gonna suck, so I bought a six-pack of beer on stage and I was just pounding beer after every few jokes bombed. I took a class at the Comic Strip Live with D.F. Sweedler, who was really nice and after the end of the class, we would run jokes every week. It was a really supportive way to start because the open mics were painful. He kind of urged me to go cleaner because he was like, ‘You can always write dirty.’ I wasn’t squeaky clean, but also when you’re 18, your life is just like, ‘I’m just a kid in school, trying to meet women.’
One of Morril’s first memories of falling in love with comedy was watching Adam Sandler movies with his brother. While many of his childhood shared his obsession with comedy sets by Chris Rock and Dave Attell, Morril’s fascination went much deeper. He knew early on that he wanted to seriously pursue a career in the field and perform on stage.
At 18, Morril performed his first set at the Comic Strip Live on the Upper East Side, which has hosted well-known comics such as Eddie Murphy and Jerry Seinfeld. But his pursuit in the city’s comedy scene was cut short when he moved to New Orleans for his undergraduate degree at Tulane. There, Morril would perform weekly stand-up sets at local open mics where many of his friends would attend, still struggling to break in as a serious comic.
But the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina made it difficult to bring light-hearted content to local audiences. In 2007, two years after the storm, Morril decided to return to New York City in search of greater opportunities.
WSN: How has growing up in New York City shaped your career?
Morril:My style of comedy was very influenced by comics I respected in New York. Every city has a different kind of style and New York was very much known for ‘Bam bam bam, hold the audience’s attention.’ I saw people I respected and how hard they worked and I was like, ‘Oh, this is more than a job.’ You really have to give everything to it and I think that goes for any form of entertainment. You kind of have to go all in, or else there’s not gonna be much of a connection with the audience.
Morril spent his early career focused on preparing small stand-up sets in New Orleans — but was hungry to jump into a bigger pond of competition as a burgeoning performer in New York City. He distinguished his experiences from most comics, who moved from small cities to major markets after garnering substantial recognition.
Building his career in the city also meant experiencing the missteps of being a young comic in the limelight. While studying at NYU, he took advice from his academic advisor to create his own degree at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where he learned the history of ancient Greek comedy. It brought him to realize the longevity of his work: Comedy has always been a universal language for people to extract humour in absurd life experiences.
WSN:What are your inspirations for your comedy?
Morril:Stand-up, for me, was trial and error completely. You kind of self-educate yourself through watching stuff that you like, and then just say, ‘Here’s how I would have done it differently.’ You get feedback the night you try it. If I really believe in something, I’ll stick with it for a while. But at a certain point, if it’s just not working, you gotta put it on the shelf to come back to it or drop it.
An old friend from college — he is very critical of me, but in a way that’s helpful because he’s very supportive as well — the stuff that makes him laugh really hard is just not gonna work on stage. You never stop learning. There’s no formula to this. If you’re putting out the exact same style each tour, it’s kind of redundant and boring to your audience — you have to be evolving.
Since February, Morril has been on the road for the “The Errors Tour” in 44 cities across the United States and Canada. The tour features Morril reflecting on his mistakes wrapped in humor. He found that while he has been known for delivering quick jokes, sustaining audiences’ interest at a one-man show requires telling stories with a personal touch. The comic will be back in New York City to perform onDec. 4at Carnegie Hall.
WSN:What advice would you give students aspiring to break into comedy?
Morril:Make sure you love it because it’s gonna be harder than you think. Social media wasn’t a thing when I started. I was mailing a DVD and a VHS tape where I started to get booked. If you like something, you can find a way to do it. Make stuff independently if you can and if you make really good stuff, somehow people will see it.
And also just don’t ever be a dick. That’s the last piece of advice. Don’t be an asshole to people because that follows you. Just be nice to people — it’s so much easier, and no one wants to be around someone who’s bringing people down.

Content Warning: this article contains mention of eating disorders.
Fad diets and problematic beauty standards have long been pervasive within our society. However, with the dawn of the internet and quickly developing social media platforms, these insidious groups take on a life of their own. While it markets itself as revolutionary path to confidence, #SkinnyTok is just a rebrand of the many online subcultures that have come before it.
#SkinnyTok is not only a viral hashtag used to promote disordered eating habits, but also a community of influencers and internet personalities who have built a brand around their appearance. Many have said the community is a revitalization of “thinspo” trends that peaked in the early 2010s on platforms like Tumblr, Instagram and Pinterest, where innocent-looking pictures of outfits and clothes intentionally accentuated the thinness of the body wearing them. Claiming that it promotes a healthy lifestyle, #SkinnyTok usesshame-based approachesand romanticizes thinness disguised as motivation.
Influencers likeLiv Schmidt,Sonya SedaghatmehrandAlexandra Peirceare just a few names that dominate the #SkinnyTok subculture. Pushing intense vocal fry and bad advice, such aswalkingup to 40,000 steps a day, the majority of those who head this movement haveno formal education or training in dietetics or nutrition.
On the surface, Schmidt’s mission isn’t entirely problematic: She claims she wants women to feel confident in their own bodies and in control of their eating habits. However, the more content you watch, it becomes clear just how judgmental, condescending and controlling her brand actually is. She’sbraggedabout fitting into children’s clothing — saying, “Being skinny isn’t a privilege, it’s a priority” — and even monetized her habits by creating “the skinni société,” a forum where users sign an NDA and pay a monthly $20 fee to engage with others about their own restriction journeys. Her content no longer seems to be about encouraging autonomy but more about normalizing dangerous habits for young women.
Research shows thatbullying, shaming or guilting individuals to lose weight usually fails, and can actually cause weight gain and further stigmatize activity out of fear of judgement. Additionally, tools gleaned from creators like these veer toward eating disorder territory: Obsessive calorie counting, food restriction and limiting diets creates unnecessary anxiety around food, which has a detrimental effect on people’s mental and physical well-being. Extreme restriction or removal of entire food groups — unless recommended by a healthcare provider — can lead toslow or irregular heartbeats, weakened bone density, hair loss and irregular periods. Body dysmorphia and increased anxiety are just some of the psychological effects of disordered eating, and this broader push for an unattainable body standard in general.
It’s clear that the focus of #SkinnyTok is not to promote healthy lifestyles or balanced and holistic diets, but rather to encourage viewers to take extreme measures to be as skinny as possible. It turns into a literal hunger game of who can be the smallest. Schmidt’s advice was deemed so extreme, her account wasbanned from TikTok. What drives these influencers and their viewers is not maintaining a healthy body for longevity’s sake, but about fitting into an unreachable standard in the name of beauty.
The majority of influencers who dominate on #SkinnyTok are also upper-class white women. Genetics, socioeconomic status and race are just some of the uncontrollable factors that influence an individual’s body and weight. The fundamental underpinnings of #SkinnyTok — and similarly strict diet cultures — are problematic, and rooted in a history ofmisogyny and white supremacy. Traditional beauty standards prioritize thin, dainty and pale women, andmodern ads and runwaysconfirm the return of this repressive “beauty is pain” archetype that alt-right groups pine for.
Students are at a unique disadvantage when it comes to falling victim to this sort of content. TikTok isdominatedby college-aged users, and college can be a uniquely dangerous backdrop fordeveloping eating disorders or problematic eating habits, perpetuated by inflammatory rhetoric such as the “freshman 15.” It’s easy to become fear-mongered into not eating enough or restricting yourself.
For those struggling with disordered eating habits, NYU offers amyriad of programsto supportrecovery. Similarly, NYU’s host of food-related clubs and organizations can offer a fun, refreshing and exciting perspective on food and dining culture in New York that can encourage students to explore different cuisines rather than restrict themselves. NYU’s three on-campus food pantries and Swipe It Forward meal program can also assist students facing food insecurity.
Disavowing #SkinnyTok begins with disengagement, such as unfollowing and reporting accounts or posts that teeter into dangerous territory. It also means discussing and engaging with those who defend #SkinnyTok influencers or promote the ideals that pervade it. Sometimes it’s our own friends and families who fall victim to these ideas.
I often hear peers downplaying the impact of #SkinnyTok — its advice often written off as self-help or simply a counter-cultural movement against today’s highly processed foods. Although well-intentioned, this kind of rhetoric underplays the movement’s harmful impact, which should be questioned. Ultimately, the content we consume and spread has more influence than we understand, and challenging popular ideals regarding thinness, healthy living and eating habits is a small step that can save many.

Centuries of craftsmanship fill the galleries of The New York Historical on the Upper West Side. “The New York Sari,” spanning from the 19th century to the modern day, explores how the traditional woven garment continues to shape South Asian identity in New York City.
Upon entering the exhibit, visitors are greeted with deep burgundy walls, adorned with floral designs reminiscent of the styles and vibrant colors found in saris. A blend of South Asian and American jazz plays in the background while samples of textiles and spices traditionally used in South Asia hang by the entrance, introducing the sari as a cultural and historical significance. Each section is accompanied by context from the saris’ owners and stories of how the garment shapes their cultural identity.
In the center of the entrance stands a large sculptural piece, named “she arose (from a pool of tears,” which showcases the intricate footwork, hand gestures and body movement of Bharatnatyam, a traditional South Indian dance. The piece, made by multidisciplinary artist Suchitra Mattai, is composed of vibrantly colored saris braided together to honor the artist’s heritage and the cultural exchange between everyone who wore them. The work becomes not just a garment, but a connection to culture, and a symbol of resistance and tradition.
“The story of how the sari became part of the cultural fabric of New York City is also a story of how the city is so much richer because of the different kinds of cultural representations that come into the city,” Anna Danziger Halperin, director of the Center for Women’s History and co-curator of the exhibition, told WSN.
The exhibit traces how South Asian culture entered American life through 19th-century migration and persevered despite challenges ranging fromimmigration quotasto citizenship limitations. One such historical piece is a cotton and linen bedcover hand-painted with kalamkari motifs — once central to British India’s trade and later mass-produced in Europe as chintz, inspiring Western bohemian aesthetics.
In a section dedicated to dance and performance, the sari is highlighted as central to the identity for South Asian dancers who introduced traditional dances to the city and who now play a role in diverse dance forms that blend classical, modern and fusion styles. One displayed sari is a beige pleated garment with golden silk pleats wrapped along the waist, a costume that dancer Jeeno Joseph wore for the Nadanam Collective’s production of “Rachana.”
“Rachana is a weaving of those roots with my lived experience,” Joseph wrote in text accompanying the exhibit. “Dancing alongside dear friends who share parallel journeys makes this offering even more powerful — together, we are shaping our own language of belonging.”
Fashion label SAMAVAI’s patchwork shirt brings gender expression into the conversation. Composed of vintage saris, it differs from the traditional draped dresses worn by women through a repurposing of how the garment is perceived and paying tribute to ancestral pieces. Through challenging traditional methods, the sari emerges as a powerful symbol of gender liberation and self-expression while preserving a shared cultural heritage.
“We really wanted to show gender diversity and that the sari is not just one particular kind of femininity,” Halperin said.
Another section explores the sari’s political significance, featuring a pleated sari adorned with sequins worn by Shahana Hanif, the first South Asian woman elected to the New York City Council. The section shows how the sari extends beyond fashion to serve as evidence of South Asians identity and empowerment.
At the end of the exhibit, visitors are invited to “Show Us Your Sari!” by sending in photos via social media or a QR code. Through this interactive aspect, they can share a bit of their narrative and connection to the sari, which is then displayed on TV screens for all to see. The submitted stories range from treasured family heirlooms to statements of contemporary identity, all honoring the South Asian immigrants who have made their culture an integral part of New York City’s identity.

SoHo glitters with dazzling storefronts housing all the big name brands you could think of: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel and more. Customers seem to sleep walk when they enter these stores, imagining what it would be like to don such high-end pieces that they can see but not touch.
But on Oct. 29, just south of these star-lit shops on Lafayette Street, customers clutching canvas-sized bags and foldable storage carts anxiously waited for doors to open at 10 a.m. Beyond them was the Isabel Marant sample sale, hosted in an LED-lit warehouse room crammed with clothing racks carrying luxury suits, dresses, skirts, pants, shirts, shoes and more — with prices ranging from $60 for swimwear to $480 for coats with retail prices of over $2400.
“I want a bag that is normally $1,000 and it’s being sold for $220,” Mallory Myers, 26, said while waiting in the long line. “For $220, I would splurge.”
Especially popular in New York City, sample sales refer to limited time events selling majorly discounted high fashion surplus items. While they are intended to sellitemssuch as blueprint designs for factory-produced clothing, clothes for editorial shoots, runway wear or outfits that got scrapped in production, sample sales generally offer any high-end brand excess stock discounted up to 70% to 90% off retail prices.
Sample sales originated in New York in the’70s and ’80s, but very few people knew about them then, as word of sample sales was often only spoken of among fashion industry insiders. In the ’90s, however, early internet blogs and sites brought attention to them, resulting in customersspending their afternoonwork breaks in the Garment District in Midtown in search for sample sales.
Since 2023, sample sales have circulated social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, with80 million viewslinked to various sample sales on TikTok alone.
At the same time as the Isabel Marant sale, 260 Sample Sale’s location on Broome Street was also bustling with customers for the Loeffler Randall sale. Zoe Deal, 30, exited the store carrying a bag filled with four pairs of shoes and a belt. When Deal moved to SoHo from Wisconsin, she found lower Manhattan filled with sample sales, with some producing special memories for her. It was there that she found  her after-party dress for her wedding — anHervé Légerdress sold at 90% off the original price.
“Those types of experiences, where you feel like you will find a diamond in the rough, make you have hope that you’re going to find something like that again,” Deal said.
Deal is drawn to sample sale shopping because of memories she holds thrift-shopping with her grandmother and father back in her hometown. She compared thrifting to sample sale-shopping because of the opportunity it provides to find a unique piece with limited resources.
“We grew up in Wisconsin and there was always this desire to have access to things that people in cities had, or to just to look different, because everyone kind of wore the same thing,” Deal said. “So I think trying to find individuality or working with the resources that you have in a different, more creative way has always been appealing.”
Some people, however, hold a different view on sample sales. Luke Adelson-Yan, a sophomore at the College of Arts and Science, was an intern for a small luxury brand called Luxenburg over the summer, and described how his creative director constantly promoted the idea of putting out sample sales for overstock items simply for marketing purposes.
“The sample sale wasn’t to build a community or promote Luxenburg as a brand, it was to make money,” Adelson-Yan said. “It was just a way of, ‘Let’s discount this because it’s overstock, no one wants it and because we’re a luxury brand, someone will buy it at a cheap price.’”
Similarly, some claim that they are also a product of luxury brands contributing to capitalistic practices of overconsumption,selling less desirable productsto the masses while gatekeeping the higher quality items. Regardless, sample sales certainly have their perks by making luxury more accessible for shoppers outside of the small circle of the high fashion industry.
It’s undeniable that these discounted popups have created communities online and united fashion fanatics, thrifters and anyone with an inkling of interest in fashion at the locations of various sample sales around New York City. In a city where being fashionable is often a tradeoff with ever-rising prices, sample sales contribute to the formation of a sustainable and more diverse fashion community.

“Those types of experiences, where you feel like you will find a diamond in the rough, make you have hope that you’re going to find something like that again,” Deal said.
Deal is drawn to sample sale shopping because of memories she holds thrift-shopping with her grandmother and father back in her hometown. She compared thrifting to sample sale-shopping because of the opportunity it provides to find a unique piece with limited resources.
“We grew up in Wisconsin and there was always this desire to have access to things that people in cities had, or to just to look different, because everyone kind of wore the same thing,” Deal said. “So I think trying to find individuality or working with the resources that you have in a different, more creative way has always been appealing.”
Some people, however, hold a different view on sample sales. Luke Adelson-Yan, a sophomore at the College of Arts and Science, was an intern for a small luxury brand called Luxenburg over the summer, and described how his creative director constantly promoted the idea of putting out sample sales for overstock items simply for marketing purposes.
“The sample sale wasn’t to build a community or promote Luxenburg as a brand, it was to make money,” Adelson-Yan said. “It was just a way of, ‘Let’s discount this because it’s overstock, no one wants it and because we’re a luxury brand, someone will buy it at a cheap price.’”
Similarly, some claim that they are also a product of luxury brands contributing to capitalistic practices of overconsumption,selling less desirable productsto the masses while gatekeeping the higher quality items. Regardless, sample sales certainly have their perks by making luxury more accessible for shoppers outside of the small circle of the high fashion industry.
It’s undeniable that these discounted popups have created communities online and united fashion fanatics, thrifters and anyone with an inkling of interest in fashion at the locations of various sample sales around New York City. In a city where being fashionable is often a tradeoff with ever-rising prices, sample sales contribute to the formation of a sustainable and more diverse fashion community.

'''
In New York City, sample sales are offering majorly discounted luxury goods, making high fashion more accessible. These limited-time events, popular in areas like SoHo, feature surplus items from top brands at discounts of up to 70-90% off retail prices. For instance, at an Isabel Marant sale on October 29 on Lafayette Street, coats originally priced over $2,400 were available for $480. While many shoppers seek unique finds, the events have drawn some criticism. Luke Adelson-Yan, a sophomore at NYU’s College of Arts and Science, noted from his internship experience that some brands use sales primarily as a marketing tool to sell unwanted overstock. Fueled by social media platforms like TikTok, these sales have nonetheless become a popular way for shoppers, including students, to affordably acquire luxury pieces in an expensive city.

Around 35 philosophy professors and students across North America and Europe discussed the concept of intentionality — what they call “the mind’s capacity to direct itself toward something” — at NYU’s 20th annualIssues in Modern Philosophyconference.
“Do not, whatever you do — under no circumstances — do not think about the camel,” Rice University professor Uriah Kriegel told attendees in the closing speech.
Attendees received a $1,000 cash prize if they could follow Kriegel’s challenge, which was based on theories of “unconscious intentionality.” It was part of his closing remarks, where he referencedhis own book“Conscious Intentionality: What Vision and Mood Teach Us,” and aimed to describe how thought resists simple commands.
“Unconscious intentionality is the thing that you instantiated in your mind when you were thinking,” Kriegel said. “Some of you may have had an image of a camel. Some of you may have had conceptual representation. But these are all varieties of conscious intentionality.”
The two-day event — held on Nov. 7 and 8 by NYU’s philosophy department featured 12 guest speakers, commentators and chairs from schools including Columbia University, the University of Alberta, King’s College London and the University of Copenhagen.
Marek Lehocký, a graduate student at Fordham University, told WSN that he heard about the conference from a friend at NYU Abu Dhabi and had been curious about what other philosophers thought about intentionality. Another attendee, Jacob Geisler, told WSN he “is always keeping up to date with the NYU philosophy presentations,” and is consistently impressed by the size of its science and philosophy conferences.
“The aim was to produce a conference that will interest not just people at NYU but throughout the region,” philosophy department chair Don Garrett said in an interview with WSN. “It’s not just for academics — we also want to reach people who are simply interested in philosophy.”
On Friday, three speakers discussed the works of prominent philosophers René Descartes, who applied mathematical concepts to philosophy, Baruch Spinoza, who focused on philosophy and religion, and Immanuel Kant, a major thought leader during the Enlightenment. The second day featured three speakers who analyzed readings from philosophers Franz Brentano, who integrated philosophy and psychology, and Edmund Husserl, founding father of phenomenology.
NYU first held the conference in 2004 as both an effort to promote philosophy at the university and a resource for students and scholars. Now a fixture of the department’s calendar, organizers find scholars from around the world to give presentations, always concluding with a discussion on contemporary philosophy. Next year’s topic will focus on political philosophy and the social contract, according to Garrett.
“It’s been wonderful to see it become such an established thing people look forward to every year,” Garrett said. “We initially didn’t know how many people would show up to it so the attendance has been very gratifying.”

President Linda Millsformally announcedthe creation of NYU’s Courant Institute School of Mathematics, Computing, and Data Science, a school aimed at building on NYU’s efforts to prepare students for a rapidly expanding tech industry.
The new school will house an expanded computer science department, merging programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and TandonSchool of Engineering, as well as the Center for Data Science and NYU’s mathematics department. Based out of Warren Weaver Hall, it will also offer a dozen graduate and Ph.D. degrees, including Atmosphere Ocean Science, Information Systems and Scientific Computing.
Undergraduate students currently enrolled in mathematics, computer science or data science programs at CAS or Tandon will not face any changes to their academic requirements, and will still complete their degrees through their respective school.
“The main thing to know about the creation of this new school is that it is incredibly exciting news, it will be transformative and it is another major step forward in our efforts to advance science and technology at NYU,” Tandon Dean Juan de Pablo said in a statement to WSN. “The school’s primary impact on students will be to benefit academically from the intensified momentum, expanded resources, and elevated energy of the new Courant Institute School.”
Gérard Ben Arous, a Courant professor of over 20 years, wasappointed to interimly lead the instituteat the start of the semester. NYU is currently conducting an international search for Courant’s permanent dean for fall 2026.Faculty across the involved departments began publiclydiscussing the potential new school inFebruary, and reaffirmed plans at aJuneboard of trustees meeting.
“These initiatives, coupled with the success of current students and faculty, are positioning NYU to be a future leader in the science and technology sphere,” a recap of the meeting read.
The Courant Institute School of Mathematics, Computing, and Data Scienceis one part of Mills’ science and technology expansion at NYU. In November 2024, the universitypurchasednew office space on Broadway for STEM programming. It also committed to spending$1 billionon Tandon’s engineering program in an effort to compete with the nation’s top engineering schools, and itranked No. 1in New York state for research spending.
The school was named afterRichard Courant,a professor from Germany who brought global mathematicians to his researchgroup at NYU in the 1930s. It was supported by the U.S. government and aimed to apply challenging mathematics research to military purposes, eventually leading to practical solutions in fields such as physics and engineering. Since the department’s transformation into a mathematics institute in the 1940s, its students have become nationally recognized scientists and produced research in fields like artificial intelligence.
“Now, we take the next great step on the path that Professor Courant started us on,” Mill wrote in Thursday’s universitywide email announcing the change. “This pivotal moment for NYU marks a major advance in our strategic commitment to science and technology, building on the remarkable ascent of NYU’s research enterprise over the past decade.”

“These initiatives, coupled with the success of current students and faculty, are positioning NYU to be a future leader in the science and technology sphere,” a recap of the meeting read.
The Courant Institute School of Mathematics, Computing, and Data Scienceis one part of Mills’ science and technology expansion at NYU. In November 2024, the universitypurchasednew office space on Broadway for STEM programming. It also committed to spending$1 billionon Tandon’s engineering program in an effort to compete with the nation’s top engineering schools, and itranked No. 1in New York state for research spending.
The school was named afterRichard Courant,a professor from Germany who brought global mathematicians to his researchgroup at NYU in the 1930s. It was supported by the U.S. government and aimed to apply challenging mathematics research to military purposes, eventually leading to practical solutions in fields such as physics and engineering. Since the department’s transformation into a mathematics institute in the 1940s, its students have become nationally recognized scientists and produced research in fields like artificial intelligence.
“Now, we take the next great step on the path that Professor Courant started us on,” Mill wrote in Thursday’s universitywide email announcing the change. “This pivotal moment for NYU marks a major advance in our strategic commitment to science and technology, building on the remarkable ascent of NYU’s research enterprise over the past decade.”

'''
New York University President Linda Mills has formally announced the creation of the Courant Institute School of Mathematics, Computing, and Data Science. The new school, based in Warren Weaver Hall, will merge programs from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Tandon School of Engineering, housing the mathematics department, an expanded computer science department, and the Center for Data Science. For current undergraduate students in mathematics, computer science, or data science at CAS or Tandon, there will be no changes to academic requirements, and they will still complete their degrees through their original schools. Professor Gérard Ben Arous will serve as the interim leader, with a search for a permanent dean to be appointed by fall 2026. This initiative is part of a larger university effort to advance its science and technology offerings, which also includes a $1 billion investment in Tandon’s engineering program. Tandon Dean Juan de Pablo stated the school will benefit students through expanded resources and intensified academic momentum.

NYU’s College Democrats said they were “forced” to end their weekly meeting early last week after members of the College Republicans disrupted the event, just a few days before the two clubs’ biannual debate wascanceled last-minute.
In aThursday Instagram statement, the College Democrats claimed that College Republicans showed up to the club’s meeting with intentions to “disrupt and provoke” its members. They said the group sat at the back of the room and projected loud noises from a speaker, laughing at and interrupting the discussions its members disagreed with. After the meeting, College Democrats reached out to NYU, informing it of the incident.”
“The university reviewed the situation independently and indefinitely postponed the interclub debates,” College Democrats said in the Instagram post. “We support that decision. No meaningful exchange of ideas can happen in an environment where students feel unsafe or at risk of harassment.”
The post detailed that College Republicans members allegedly likened the Democrats’ endorsement of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to their support of a “second holocaust.” CAS junior and College Republicans President Ryan Leonard denied the claim, saying that one member of his group told Democrats to “cool it with the antisemitic remarks,” but the conversation was unrelated.
College Democrats also said the Republicans posted a “non-consensual” image of the interference on social media and liked comments “sexualizing and harassing” a member of the club. Thepostdepicted Leonard addressing the member, with a caption reading that “only FOUR PEOPLE had shown up” to the club’s meeting. Leonard told WSN it was the group’s way of “joking around.”
“We think that all perspectives are important, and we wanted to show up to say hello and have an open conversation,”  Leonard said in an interview. “There were multiple witnesses there from both sides who have said that there was no harassment, no verbal attacks, no playing noises.”
Theuniversity is reviewing the incident andtemporarily canceledthe debate, which had initially been scheduled for Wednesday.
Hours after the Democrats’ statement, the College Republicans posted an image of a boxer standing over his opponent in a match, faces covered by the student groups’ logos, captioned “TOTAL COLLEGE REPUBLICANS VICTORY!” They claimed the opposing group “forced” the Politics Society, which organizes the debate, to craft debate questions favorable to them. Both the College Democrats and the Politics Society told WSN the accusation is untrue.
“We are concerned by Leonard’s comment that we did not offer College Republicans a chance to request changes to the debate topics,” Politics Society President Chloe Claytor told WSN in a statement. “We offered both sides the same opportunity to review and raise concerns about the topics beforehand … our goal is to be a non-partisan space for students.”
NYU is also meeting with the College Republicans as part of its evaluation, according to Leonard. College Democrats said in the statement they are “committed” to working with the university to resolve the situation and reinstate the debate.
“We have serious concerns about the conduct of the NYU College Republicans’ leadership,” the Democrats said. “NYU College Democrats remain committed to working with the University to resolve these issues and are ready to debate those who act in good faith and with respect.”

Two military recruitment exercises in Kumasi and Accra led to separate stampedes that killed at least six people and wounded dozens on Wednesday, causing a temporary suspension of events.
The Ghana Armed Forces said in a broadcast statement that the Accra stampede occurredaround 6:20 a.m.when a surge of applicants “breached security protocols and rushed” into the El-Wak Sports Stadium ahead of scheduled screenings.
“We witnessed a sad event today, we encountered a disaster,” President John Mahama toldTRT World.
Ashanti Regional Minister Frank Amoakohene confirmed that Kumasi’s stampede occurred at Baba Yara Sports Stadium, where at least five recruits, who are now receiving medical care, suffered “severe injuries.”
Mahama previously mandated that the recruitment drives be open to the public to provide young people with equal access to join the military. As Ghana battles youth unemployment rates of roughly 39% — and nearly 68% of employed youth work in low-paying, short-term “vulnerable jobs” — the recruitments often attract large crowds of young people.
Later that day, the president arrived at 37 Military Hospital in Accra, where 28 people sought medical treatment. Six have died, five are in the Intensive Care Unit and 12 remain in critical condition. Military officials said that families of the deceased are being contacted and that they will continue to monitor the situation.
No casualties were reported after the newly built Hongqi Bridgepartially collapsedfollowing a landslide in China’s southwest Sichuan province.
Authoritiesclosed the nearly 2,500-foot bridge— which was completed in January and is part of a national highway that connects to Tibet — on Monday, aftercracks were found on surrounding roads and slopes.By Tuesday afternoon, the landslide’s worsening conditions led to the partial collapse, officials said.
One truck was on the bridge at the time of the collapse, though the driver wasrescued successfully, according to Chinese media.
The construction comes during a surge of hundreds of bridge projects in China, many of which have piled up debt despite the use ofgovernment loans. The incident follows the northwest Shanghai-Qinghai railwaycollapse in Augustover a major river, which killed at least 12 workers and left four missing.
Adetour is now in place, and it is unclear when the bridge will reopen, according to government officials.
The Spanish Agriculture Ministry ordered all free-range poultry farms to immediately confine their birds on Thursday as apreventive measureagainst rising bird flu cases.
The new measure expands on othersimposed last week, which required poultry in high-risk areas to be confined indoors. Its policies also ban breeding poultry outdoors, sharing water sources with wild birds and raising ducks and geese alongside other species. Spain has locked down about 1,200 high-risk municipalities since Monday, and has seen14 bird flu outbreaks on farmsthis year.
“In Spain, it has been proven that there are a lot of birds migrating in humid areas,” the ministrysaid in a statement. “The measure tries to avoid that poultry can be in contact with migrating birds that carry the virus.”
Officials also said that they can grant permission to keep domestic birds outdoors “if contact with wild birds can be effectively prevented using some type of enclosure or device.” Interested farmers can apply for permission through their county agriculture office if they meet the given requirements.
Concerns havespiked across Europeand the United States, where aboutseven million farmed birdshave died of bird flu since September. Countries including Ireland, France,England,Belgiumandthe Netherlandshave already taken steps to address risks as birds migrate to Europe for the winter. Germany stands as the most affected EU country this season, with58 of the 136 reported outbreaksacross the continent.

Ashanti Regional Minister Frank Amoakohene confirmed that Kumasi’s stampede occurred at Baba Yara Sports Stadium, where at least five recruits, who are now receiving medical care, suffered “severe injuries.”
Mahama previously mandated that the recruitment drives be open to the public to provide young people with equal access to join the military. As Ghana battles youth unemployment rates of roughly 39% — and nearly 68% of employed youth work in low-paying, short-term “vulnerable jobs” — the recruitments often attract large crowds of young people.
Later that day, the president arrived at 37 Military Hospital in Accra, where 28 people sought medical treatment. Six have died, five are in the Intensive Care Unit and 12 remain in critical condition. Military officials said that families of the deceased are being contacted and that they will continue to monitor the situation.
No casualties were reported after the newly built Hongqi Bridgepartially collapsedfollowing a landslide in China’s southwest Sichuan province.
Authoritiesclosed the nearly 2,500-foot bridge— which was completed in January and is part of a national highway that connects to Tibet — on Monday, aftercracks were found on surrounding roads and slopes.By Tuesday afternoon, the landslide’s worsening conditions led to the partial collapse, officials said.
One truck was on the bridge at the time of the collapse, though the driver wasrescued successfully, according to Chinese media.
The construction comes during a surge of hundreds of bridge projects in China, many of which have piled up debt despite the use ofgovernment loans. The incident follows the northwest Shanghai-Qinghai railwaycollapse in Augustover a major river, which killed at least 12 workers and left four missing.
Adetour is now in place, and it is unclear when the bridge will reopen, according to government officials.
The Spanish Agriculture Ministry ordered all free-range poultry farms to immediately confine their birds on Thursday as apreventive measureagainst rising bird flu cases.
The new measure expands on othersimposed last week, which required poultry in high-risk areas to be confined indoors. Its policies also ban breeding poultry outdoors, sharing water sources with wild birds and raising ducks and geese alongside other species. Spain has locked down about 1,200 high-risk municipalities since Monday, and has seen14 bird flu outbreaks on farmsthis year.
“In Spain, it has been proven that there are a lot of birds migrating in humid areas,” the ministrysaid in a statement. “The measure tries to avoid that poultry can be in contact with migrating birds that carry the virus.”
Officials also said that they can grant permission to keep domestic birds outdoors “if contact with wild birds can be effectively prevented using some type of enclosure or device.” Interested farmers can apply for permission through their county agriculture office if they meet the given requirements.
Concerns havespiked across Europeand the United States, where aboutseven million farmed birdshave died of bird flu since September. Countries including Ireland, France,England,Belgiumandthe Netherlandshave already taken steps to address risks as birds migrate to Europe for the winter. Germany stands as the most affected EU country this season, with58 of the 136 reported outbreaksacross the continent.

Student government members voted on Thursday to approve a letter demanding that NYU adopt stronger recruitment and support systems for Black students, and will formally pass the resolution after receiving absentee ballots within the next week.
The letter, which garnered nearly300 signatoriesfrom students, faculty, alumni and on-campus organizations, raises concerns over NYU’sdeclining admissions of Black studentsand public threats targeting Black community members over the past year. It says that the university failed to take substantial actions to protect the safety of Black students, suggesting that it develop recruitment programs in predominantly Black communities and establish a dedicated space for Black students on campus.
“It is crucial that NYU centers students’ voices and validates their concerns with urgency,” Kyla Bernal, CAS senior and senator at-large for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander students, told WSN. “NYU administrators have had a lack of transparency with the issues going on around campus, especially the threat that targeted the Black community at NYU.”
All Student Government Assembly members present at Thursday’s meeting voted to approve the letter. However, because attendance did not reach the SGA’s 37-person requirement to pass resolutions, senators will send out absentee ballots and receive them within the next week.
The letter was initially presented around two months ago, immediately after ahoax shooting manifestothreatening to open fire at Black students and faculty circulated the NYU community. President Linda Millsfaced backlashfrom the Black Student Union, among other on-campus groups, which said her initial responseslacked claritybecause they didn’t disclose the threat’s anti-Black nature — leaving many students to learn details through social media reposts.
The letter suggests that the university reaffirm a policy of zero tolerance for anti-Black racism, make its safety alerts more specific and create a reparations committee to address NYU’s historical and current ties to slavery. Stern junior Christian Howze, author of the letter and senator at-large for Black students and students of color, said at the meeting that passing the statement was the best way to present the SGA’s advocacy for Black students.
Senators also debated the extent to which the student government should spend its annual $500,000 budget on services from companies that don’t align with its goal of supporting human rights.
Zahraa Al-Saif, who presented the proposal and is the senator at-large for Arab students and Shia Muslims, told WSN that the SGA’s future spending should match the values of itsprevious resolutions. Al-Saif cited the student government’s history of statementscondemningcivilian deaths in Israel’s war in Gaza,boycottingfood providers invested in the prison industrial complex and pushing toreplacean on-campus Chick-fil-A.
“It’s really important for SGA to put its money where its mouth is,” Al-Saif said. “This resolution will be all-encompassing of everything that has been said in the past and everything that will come in the future.”
Several students raised concerns about how to determine ethical standards for businesses, and what interactions — such as hiring a speaker who opposes an issue the SGA advocates for — the resolution would prohibit. They also questioned whether the proposal would be feasible, noting that the SGA makes use of services provided by companies like Amazon for essential activities.
CAS senior Emma Bell, senator at-large for students with disabilities, said in a statement to WSN that she suggested the resolution be a recommendation for SGA purchases rather than a strict prohibition on certain businesses.
Senators involved in the proposal will work out details over the next few months before bringing it back for an assemblywide vote.
“This resolution is really a love letter from me to the efforts of SGA members in the past, and an aid for all SGA members in the future,” Al-Saif said. “When you see all of our work, you see SGA standing up for many causes: human rights, global conflict, climate change. Those efforts should not disappear as just words of encouragement or campaigning and should be actualized.”

On Thursday, New York University’s Student Government Assembly (SGA) voted to approve a letter demanding stronger university support for Black students. The letter, which has nearly 300 signatories, was prompted by concerns over a hoax shooting manifesto that threatened Black students and faculty two months ago. Student groups criticized President Linda Mills’ initial response for lacking clarity about the threat's anti-Black nature, causing many to learn details via social media. Key demands in the letter include creating a dedicated campus space for Black students and making university safety alerts more specific. Although approved by all members present, the resolution requires absentee ballots for formal passage as the meeting fell short of its 37-person attendance requirement. Separately, the SGA also debated a proposal to align its $500,000 annual budget with its human rights goals, which could affect future spending on campus services.
