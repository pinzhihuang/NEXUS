    New York University (NYU) today announced a new initiative to support international students 
    facing challenges with the recent changes in U.S. visa application processes. The initiative, 
    detailed on the NYU Office of Global Services website, includes dedicated workshops, extended 
    advising hours, and a new online portal for document submission. This comes after several 
    students, particularly from China, reported increased scrutiny and delays. University President 
    Linda G. Mills stated, "NYU is committed to its global community, and we will provide all 
    necessary resources to help our international students navigate these complexities." The changes 
    are expected to benefit hundreds of students preparing for the upcoming academic year. The announcement 
    was made on May 21, 2024, and details are also available on the main NYU news page.
